// This is a basic JavaScript code that declares a variable count and assigns it an initial value of 0. It then defines a function called counter() which logs the value of count to the console using console.log(count).

// Then, within the counter() function, the value of count is incremented by 1 using the count = count + 1; statement.

// Finally, the setTimeout() function is used to schedule the counter() function to be executed again after a delay of 1000 milliseconds (or 1 second), effectively creating a loop that continuously increments and logs the value of count every second.

// So when you call counter() at the end, it starts executing the counter() function and logs the current value of count to the console. It then increments count by 1 and schedules the counter() function to be executed again after a delay of 1000 milliseconds. This process repeats indefinitely, resulting in a counter that increments every second and logs its current value to the console.

var count = 0;
(function counter() {
  console.log(count);
  count = count + 1;
  setTimeout(counter, 1000);
})();
