/*
  Implement a function 'calculateTotalSpentByCategory' that takes a list of transactions as a parameter and
  returns a list of objects. Each object is unique category-wise and has the total price spent as its value.
  
  Transaction: 'itemName,' 'category,' 'price,' and 'timestamp.'
  Output: [{category1: total_amount_spent_on_category1}, {category2: total_amount_spent_on_category2}].

  Once you've implemented the logic, test your code by running
  - `npm run test-expenditure-analysis`
*/

function calculateTotalSpentByCategory(transactions) {
  return [];

module.exports = calculateTotalSpentByCategory;
