Create the user side of a course selling app. This means the backend remains the same, but now you have two websites. Routes should be very similar to the old ones, but now you need to add a new route for the user to see the contents of a single course. You need to create the boilerplate yourself using vite

Frontend Routes expected -

/courses - shows all courses
/courses/purchased - Shows all purchased courses
/courses/:id - Shows a single course, allows user to purchase it
/login - login page
/signup - signup page
/ - Landing page
By the end of this you should have two frontends -

One for the admin dashboard (02-medium-course-selling-app-admin-dashboard)
One for the user side of the app (03-hard-course-selling-app-user-side
